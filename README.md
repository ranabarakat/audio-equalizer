# audio-equalizer
Audio equalizer implementation using MATLAB app designer.

## Background

Audio equalization is the process of regulating the frequencies of an electronic signal, and the tool that enables this process is called an equalizer. This tool
is employed in auditoriums to reduce undesirable noise and reverb, as well as when recording and reproducing music. Its employment in the music industry is supposedly the one that most people think of in relationship to equalizers.
The main objective of this project is to implement a graphic equalizer in MATLAB. The equalizer is intended to process audio signals in real time. MATLAB App Designer is used for the programming and the construction of the graphical user interface (GUI).

The GUI layout contains sliders for 9 different frequency band gains and a field for modifying the sampling frequency. The graphs compare the input sound signal and the modified signal in both time and frequency domain. The modified (composite) signal is generated by clicking the PLOT button followed by the PLOT SPECTRUM button. The analysis of each filter and the impulse/step response can be viewed by choosing the relevent band in the drop down menu. One can listen to the modified sound by clicking the PLAY button after generating the composite signal.
